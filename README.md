  (TO DO ADD A PICTURE HERE)
  Betty 
  
  She has working as a teacher for 30 years at Mexico's Telephony 
  Company.  Currently, she  writes exams manually and photocopies
  the write up.  
  
  Betty has two daughters and one son.  All of them are in their 
  20's.

  Betty is a fun person and likes to spend time with her husband and 
  friends on the weekends. Unfortunately she spends so much time writing
  exams that she has to work on the weekends quite frequently.
  
  Betty would like to use Test Vault for multiple reasons
  1. It will allow her to re-use content and save time
  2. It will allow other teachers to collaborate by adding other
  questions to Test Vault
  3. The questions will be available for future re-use
