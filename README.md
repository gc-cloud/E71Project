#### You did a whole team relative size estimating activity. You documented the name of the activity in your README. 1.0 pts
>  The estimates were produced collaboratively over two Google Hangout sessions. We decided to adopt  a Fibonacci approach
>  using 5 as a reference for the amount of work needed to develop a typical web form.  Using the initial benchmark of 5, we debated and talked through the story points
>  needed to complete each task based on our individual experiences/expertise and came to a consensus on the level
>  of effort for the other backlog items.

#### Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates. You've made note of this in your README. 1.0 pts

>  Participants on the hangouts were:
>    * Alberto Garza - Developer
