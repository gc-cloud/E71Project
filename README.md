###Project Part 2 / Sprint 1 Criteria
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during the sprint. The forecast is documented in your README. 1.0 pts

> Forecast is 151 story points out of 373 total in MVP backlog, consisting of 4 PBIs out of 13.

#### The rationale for your forecast is documented in your README. 1.0 pts

> The forecast for the first sprint consists of the first 4 PBIs:

> 1) Set up App

> 2) Add Q&A

> 3) Add Seeder Content

> 4) View Question/Answer Bank

> The rationale for this selection is that these 4 PBIs consist of setting up the framework, setting up the initial styling of site, and adding basic functionality for the Q&A
> form so that questions and answers can be added and viewed.  These items are pivotal to complete early on because of potential technical issues that may come up while
> setting up the Play Framework, and also because the other important operations such Updating Q&As, Deleting Q&As, creating/printing exams, and authentication will
> extend these basic functions.  The total story points for Sprint 1 is estimated to be 151 out of 373 in the total MVP backlog.

#### You pulled stories into your sprint backlog. You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast. Only Development Team members participated in this activity. 4.0 pts

> [Sprint 1 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 1 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing)

> The aggregate size of the stories that were pulled from the project backlog to the first sprint does not exceed total forecast.  Four of the 13 MPV PBIs
> were selected for fist sprint.  Only Development Team Members participated in pulling stories into sprint backlog.

#### All of the stories in your sprint backlog have size less than half your forecast velocity. If you noticed PBIs that are too large to get done in a sprint, you refined them by splitting them into smaller stories and estimating the smaller stories. 1.0 pts

> All the stories in the sprint backlog have size less than half of the total forecast.  Below are the sizes of each backlog item:
 
> 1) Set up App - 49

> 2) Add Q&A - 55

> 3) Add Seeder Content - 21

> 4) View Question/Answer Bank - 26

> Total sprint backlog size: 151

> Initially, backlog items #2 & #3, Add Q&A and Add Seeder Content, were a single item with 76 story points, but they were split up into two separate stories, "As a teacher, I want to add
> exam questions and answers to repository....." and "As a teacher, I want to be able to see pre-populated content" to ensure all stories are less than half the total forecast
> and to enable more efficient management of our sprint backlog items.

#### You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog. 2.0 pts

> All stories were already decomposed into tasks in the first deliverable of project.

> [Sprint 1 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 1 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Your sprint backlog, including both stories and tasks, is represented in a kanban board. The kanban board, or a URL of the kanban board, is documented in your README. Richard can view the kanban board. 3.0 pts

> [Kanban Board on Trello.com](https://trello.com/b/ctBXfXtq/testorama)

#### You have a sprint burn-down chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart, is document in your README. Richard can view the burndown chart. 8.0 pts

> [Sprint 1 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 1 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing)

#### You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You have evidence of at least one daily scrum documented in your README. 5.0 pts

> See Above

#### Do you see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan? 3.0 pts
> See Above

#### Update your sprint backlog task board and burndown chart. Make sure the URLs or images are available in your GitHub repo's README. 2.0 pts
> See Link Above

#### There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your README. 5.0 pts
> See Above

#### There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There is at least 1 BDD / A-TDD test in your test suite, and it passes. There are at least 10 unit tests in your test suite, and they all pass. 11.0 pts
> See Above

#### Your team conducts a Sprint Review. 1.0 pts
> We did a sprint review after our last scrum session.  At the end of our last scrum session, we completed all the Spring 1 backlog items.  During our Sprint 1 review,
> we determined what we did a good job pulling the Sprint 1 backlog from the total product backlog, because we finished just in time.  We also determined that TDD was more
> time-consuming than originally perceived due to the fact that we were all new to it.  Subsequently, there were ome initial challenges.  In the next sprint, a bit more time
> will be allotted to developing our unit tests to ensure we have enough time to both develop and test there items in Sprint 2.

#### Your product increment is working software. 1.0 pts
> Check out [www.testorama.online](http://www.testorama.online)

#### At least one stakeholder attends your sprint review. You revise your product backlog based on the feedback you receive. 2.0 pts
> We had Luis Hidalgo, our Product Owner, attend our sprint review.  Per his review, there did not need to be changes to the MVP backlog at this time.

###Project Part 3 / Sprint 2 Criteria
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during the sprint. Your forecast is based on the Yesterday's Weather forecasting pattern. The forecast is documented in your README.
> Yesterday's Weather is a scrum forecasting method based on the idea that yesterday's weather is likely the best predictor of today's weather.  This notion is applied to 
> Scrum by using the points in the previous Sprint to predict how many points will be completed in the upcoming sprint.  <br />

> One way to use prior sprints to predict how many points will be completed in the upcoming sprint is to take the average velocity for the past 3 sprints.  However, given 
> that we've had only one sprint and the current sprint is the second, we will use the points completed in the first sprint only.  All team members participated in the
> first sprint and all team members will continue to participate in the second sprint.  There were 151 points completed within 2 weeks 
> in the first sprint by 5 team members.  However, last sprint there were more days available to work than this 2nd sprint because of the Thanksgiving holiday during which 
> some group members will be unavailable for several days around Thanksgiving.  Subsequently, we are choosing to tackle the next 102 points (PBI #s 5-9) with the same 5 team members across the next 2 weeks.
> The decrease in points for the 2nd sprint is to ensure we get everything done in the reduced number of work days and also have time to 
> investigate the technical setup for the CI/CD requirements.  Sprint 2 encapsulates all the tasks of the next 5 backlog items without splitting any of the items.
> Completing 102 points for Sprint 2 leaves 112 points for Sprint 3 which is a good amount because there are no holidays during Sprint 3.

> **In summary, using Yesterday's Forecast method, our forecast for Sprint 2 is 102 story points out of 373 total in MVP backlog, consisting of 5 PBIs out of 13.**

#### You pulled stories into your sprint backlog. You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.

> [Sprint 2 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 2 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing) 
 
> The aggregate size of the stories that were pulled from the project backlog to the second sprint does not exceed total forecast.  Five of the 13 MPV PBIs
> were selected for second sprint.  Only Development Team Members participated in pulling stories into sprint backlog.

#### All of the stories in your sprint backlog have size less than half your forecast velocity. If you noticed PBIs that are too large to get done in a sprint, you refined them by splitting them into smaller stories and estimating the smaller stories.

> All the stories in the sprint backlog have size less than half of the total forecast.  Below are the sizes of each backlog item:
 
> 5) Update Capability - 21

> 6) Delete Capability - 8

> 7) Manual Selection - 26

> 8) Save Exams - 34

> 9) View Exams - 13

> Total sprint backlog size: 102

> None of the PBIs were too large to get done in a sprint, so no need to split them into smaller stories.

#### You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.

> Stories and their corresponding tasks are grouped together in the backlog

> [Sprint 2 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 2 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Your sprint backlog, including both stories and tasks, is represented in a kanban board. The kanban board, or a URL of the kanban board, is documented in your README. Richard can view the kanban board.

> Stories are highlighted on our Trello board with Capital letters and stories / tasks color coded to provide visual cues

#### Update your sprint backlog task board and burndown chart. Make sure the URLs or images are available in your GitHub repo's README.

> Both the Sprint 2 backlog/burndown chart and Kanban board were updated throughout the 2 weeks of the sprint.

> [Sprint 2 Backlog in Google Docs - Sprint 2 Backlog/Burndown Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QoYgJVWE09Q55wbZcUjWuv7aTQS75cbwmrXVXkWp8o/edit?usp=sharing)

> [Kanban Board on Trello.com](https://trello.com/b/ctBXfXtq/testorama)

#### There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your README.

> See above screenshots of each session in which we mob programmed.  Also, Github commits show evidence of mobprogramming sessions

#### There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There are at least 2 BDD / A-TDD test in your test suite (at least 1 new one this sprint), and it passes. There are at least 20 unit tests in your test suite (at least 10 new unit tests this sprint), and they all pass.

> For Sprint 2 we added several additional tests. A BDD approach was included many of the new tests such as testExamWithQuestionsSave() 
> and testCreateExamRetrieveQuestion (Reference: [CodeUtopia: Unit Testing, TDD and BDD](https://codeutopia.net/blog/2015/03/01/unit-testing-tdd-and-bdd/)).
>   
>  We have two batteries of tests:

> ![Alt text](readmeImages/sprint2_integration_tests.png?raw=true )
   
#### Your team conducts a Sprint Review.
>We did a sprint review after our last scrum session on Nov 27th. We agreed that we did a good job on the Sprint 2 
>because we finished slightly ahead of time despite having some initial impediments. Other positives  during the 
>sprint were  learning about Integration Testing and CI/CD. In the next sprint we are planning to complete the remainder of the 
>MVP backlog. 

#### Your product increment is working software.
> Our product increment works as expected and includes functionality to create questions, assign questions to exams, and 
> display exams.  It also shows sample seed data loaded using Play's Evolutions.

> Check out [www.testorama.online](http://www.testorama.online)

#### At least one stakeholder attends your sprint review. You revise your product backlog based on the feedback you receive.
>Luis Hidalgo attended the review as an external stakeholder. Per his feedback, the product is on track and 
> no changes to the MVP backlog are needed at this time. 
>   
> ![Alt text](readmeImages/SprintReview.png?raw=true )

#### You have a Continuous Integration system running. The CI system automatically builds your code every time you merge to master. The CI system executes your tests every time it builds the code.
